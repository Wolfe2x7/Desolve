# Desolve ('dissolve')
Run a copy of this script inside your project to convert a 3D model in OBJ format to Defold's mesh vertex buffer format, useful for wireframe rendering. It can also convert to a regular triangulated mesh. When creating a wireframe, faces do not have to be triangulated; quads and Ngons will be traced as they are.

Change the variables in the script to input your OBJ file and desired output filename.

This may not work with older/unusual OBJ formats.
